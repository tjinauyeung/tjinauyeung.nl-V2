### Tjinauyeung.nl - Portfolio
This project is V2 of my personal website currently online at [http://www.tjinauyeung.nl](tjinauyeung.nl)

Currently the project is built as a static website. For future iterations it might get converted into a next.js application with a node.js backend.
I'd like to explore componentizing the page and extend it with more features iteratively.

### Roadmap
